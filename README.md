## Updates

- 2024/01/20: BBT-RGB is accepted by LREC-COLING 2024. ðŸŽ‰
- 2023/05/03: Release the first version of BBT-RGB, please check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08088). ðŸŒˆ



## Introduction

We describe BBT-RGB in this paper, a suite of straightforward and complementary techniques for enhancing the efficiency and performance of black-box optimization. Specifically, our method includes three plug-and-play components: (1) Two-stage derivative-free optimization strategy that facilitates fast convergence and mitigates overfitting; (2) Automatic verbalizer construction with its novel usage under few-shot settings; (3) Better prompt initialization policy based on instruction search and auto-selected demonstration.
