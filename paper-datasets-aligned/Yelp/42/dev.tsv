this place is top fish in terms of poke. vast variety of tako, ahi, and crab poke. they even have dried aku, opihi, and hanalei poi. their poke is something I can eat everyday no joke. I read a review saying they would drive four an a half hrs for this poke and I would agree, this is one of those places that driving for hrs is worth the reward cause their poke is crazy good and would highly. ..HIGHLY!! Recommend them to anyone! I go there weekly and their specials is mean!! poke bowls, cone sushi, maki sushi. dis is one place you cannot go wrong, da people is awesome and you can tell they have the aloha spirit and it shows in the food they make! Mahalos for bringing a piece of home to las vegas Poke Express!	positive
I'm glad to see there are other negative reviews on here as well. The other reviewers are right, the mechanics at this place lie to the customers and invent problems that don't exist. I took my car in to have an exhaust leak fixed, and was told my front brakes AND my front shocks were completely shot. I was already suspicious because I hadn't heard any noise from the front of my car, so I took my car somewhere else. Everything was fine and to top it off, the exhaust problem that Midas found was only a small part of the problem and wouldn't have fixed the noise my car was making.\n\nVery unhappy with this place. Make sure you do your research before believing what they tell you.	negative

got so sick. there route 99 was so greasy it was oily and gross couldnt even finish it. had the worst stomach flu for 2 days.	negative
I went here to indulge a bit. It's not exactly easy to get to with the never-ending construction on Grand, but I finally made it in.\nYou need to make sure you look at ALL of the displays, including the stand-up refidgerators on the South side of the store. Because I didn't do this, I missed out on what could have been an amazing devil dog and the rainbow cookies. :(\nAs it was, I bought some of their butter cookies, which you can purchase by the pound. Yum yum! They were light and crisp. They were pretty good!\nThis store doesn't really put a lot of effort into fancying up the interior. It's 1970's chic at its finest. It also looks like Fort Knox when it's closed. It's like a prison on lock down! But, when the grates are rolled up, the windows are brightly painted for each season/holiday. Pretty nice.\n\nLooking forward to a future trip involving a devil dog...	positive
"This used to be a place I would refer to friends as a \""""must try\"""" when in Scottsdale, however - I must say I was rather disappointed upon my last visit. The service has never been a strong point for this bistro but the food always made up for it, until recently.  \n\nI was disappointed going there for a birthday brunch and the desserts tasted almost freezer-burned.  \n\nIt first began when the hostess indicated it would be about 3-5 minutes to clean a table so I told her not a problem and I would wait in the patio where she can find me when the table was ready.  I waited 20 min for a table to be cleaned off for a party of 3, while I noticed  others were continuously going in and being seated. It wasn't until I walked in and asked about my table, that the server then cleaned off the same table she originally pointed would take 3-5 min to clean.\n\nI was bothered, but tried to dismiss as an oversight so I just anxiously looked forward to the good food and great desserts.  The meals were good (I had the salad - my guests the nutella crepes) but the desserts were a disappointment.  My guests had never visited Scratch before so when asking about the desserts they were told to look at the display and given the brush off - I indicated they need to see these delicious desserts anyway and that they are usually very helpful with recommendations, so I guided my guests over to the showcase.) We stood at the display and interested in finding out if there was a house favorite, but at no time were any of the servers offering any assistance nor did OUR server ask if we were ready to order.  I finally walked over to the cashier to place our dessert order.  \n\nAs much as I RAVED about this place to friends, I was very embarrassed and disappointed during this visit.  Our drinks were not refreshed and the only thing the server was expedient was the check.  I previously rated them a 4 star due to the service needing improvement.  It seems that this establishment has gone backwards not forwards.  IF I decide to return, perhaps I'll have to place a order to go and skip the dessert.  Sadly disappointed..."	negative
DISCLAIMER: I've only ever tried the sushi. I have no clue about the hibatchi bar.\n\nI was delighted to see that I'm not the only one who finds this place to be completely overrated and overpriced. The sushi was your average run of the mill raw fish. Nothing special about the freshness or the imaginitivity of the rolls. That is, except for the price. I couldn't believe that a meal for such average sushi cost as much as it did. \n\nIf you're looking for some decent raw fish to feed your sushi craving, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill instead. You won't regret it.	negative
Service was uninsprired.  So many options at so many interesting and exciting places in Vegas . . . does not seem possible.\n\nWe were with a group of guys with big plans for the evening.  We had to stand-up, find servers to get them to come to the table to bring us more drinks.\n\nFood was very good.\n\nLike the viewing grill.\n\nRoom is tired.	negative
Found this place because my previous vision center wanted to charge well over $500 for my eye exam. Saw similar situations like mine so I checked it out. Not only got friendly service I was told my previous eye doctor was wrong in saying I could never enjoy a 3D movie because of my eye condition. Doc brought out 3D images and proved just the opposite. I can see 3D images just fine. Will definitely be back for glasses and when it's time for new contacts.	positive
I've visited Straight Up twice now- the first time would have been the last if it weren't for a gift certificate I won. \n\nThe bar service on the first visit was the worst I have ever experienced. They have this Jersey Shore reject with NO SKILL as a bartender- she is slow, lazy, forgetful, easily confused and down right rude. No joke, I cannot think of one redeeming quality she exhibits. We had intended on ordering some food but just couldn't stand to be in her presence any longer. \n\nThe second visit was better- the bartender was decent and the service was moderately better (but it was also an exceptionally slow night). Of the 3 dishes we ordered the spicy Ahi tuna is the only one worth mentioning- the tuna was decent quality and prepared very well.\n\nAt the end of the day you have to ask- there are 5 other bars in the area with the same type of food and atmosphere- why bother with this place?	negative
Cool as long as you don't mind seeing parasites in your seafood. After I showed the manager, He offered me a gift card and didn't charge me for my horrible experience and my parasite infested crab legs. Disgusting, needless to say, I won't be returning here & after this experience I'm probably never going to eat crab again!!! Thanks! Picture posted in photos!	negative
Came here for a work dinner- excellent excellent food. great ambiance and service. Was told it is a hot spot on the weekends. Did I say how excellent the food is? Can't go wrong with this one.	positive
Great spot if you are heading to the NC music Factory for a show.  \n\nGreat beer selection at a reasonable price.  Got a pitcher of blueberry beer that was delicious!  The bartender was very friendly and attentive and let us taste a few beers before we decided.  \n\nThey have a chill strip to keep you beverage frosty - sweet!\n\nThey have a large side and back porch with table tennis, bag-o boards, and tables with umbrellas.	positive
Excellent food and great freindly service. Very laid back with good music playing. Just come here and try it you won't be sorry.	positive
This is my first experience with chicken AND waffles. A bit too weird for me. Even after seperating it... eating the chicken first, then waffles... The chicken was sub-par, and the waffles were... eh...\n\nSeriously, everyone who gave this place 5 stars... have you guys/gals ever eaten at KFC? or IHOP? Now thats some good chicken and waffles.\n\nThe sweet tea was good... I also got a stomach ache later on. I'm going to have to try Rosco's Chicken and Waffles... just to compare.	negative
I went to Mad Dog Saloon to celebrate Mother's Day with my Daughter.  We each ordered a shot of whiskey.  The woman bartender accepted cash payment from me and later charged my daughter for the same two shots.  A man at the bar also paid cash for three shots for us and himself.  The bartender  took advantage of us by overcharging us.  I called the management and they seemed hesitant to get  involved.  I have been a regular customer but because of the lack of concern from the manager I will not return to this establishment.  I also would recommend people go elsewhere for a drink.	negative
LAVO pretty much ruined my Vegas trip. We were in Vegas for my girlfriend's birthday and we were staying at the Palazzo. The greeter at the door I guess worked at TAO nightclub and told us that if we ate here than we would receive free express entry into the nightclub for every entree that we purchased. TAO just happened to be the nightclub that all the girls wanted to go to and we were on the hungry side.\n\nWe sat down and our waiter split us up into two tables. I wanted to get my usual seafood linguine, but I had it the night before so I was persuaded to try something else. I asked the waiter for his recommendations and he told me the swordfish.\n\nIt's a pretty spacious room and you get to see everyone drinking their Voss bottled water. I thought it was weird that the sinks of the restrooms were visable from downstairs. Not the best layout in my opinion; when your guests can enjoy their meal and watch their fellow patrons drop a twosie.\n\nEven though we were seated and waited on at the same time as the second half of our party, the food arrive at very different times. We all pretty much ordered the same items, but everything came out sporadically. Not that I wanted my entree to be rushed out... The swordfish was dry and the serving size was pretentious. I understand that they were probably shooting for French servings, but when I saw the hefty dishes that others in my group received, I was a bit peeved.\n\nNonetheless, this was not even the worst part of the night. The worst part came, when we got to TAO and the bouncers told us that the stubs that we received were only good at LAVO. At this point, I had had enough. I called over to LAVO and made my complaint to the hostess. She tried to convince me that for the longest time, the stubs would only allow them entry into LAVO. I argued with her and she even accused me of lying. After long deliberation, I spoke with the manager and she told me to get in contact with the manager at TAO. When I got back to TAO, the retarded bouncers wouldn't even let me talk to the manager. I'm surprised those Neanderthals knew how to conjugate words into sentences. Eventually I get to someone who I think can help me and they end up telling me we can get in with the stubs and that's how it's always worked. They need to get their freaking facts straight.\n\nWorst experience I've ever dealt with. I already had distaste for nightclubs in Vegas. This was just the straw that broke the camel's back.	negative
After reading some of the previous reviews I guess you have to be from the Southeast to under stand how prolific steak and shake really is. I remember going to my first one in Florida before they moved the chain outside of the state. Due to this I understand why people will wait in line for this place.\n\nTo our most recent experience. The line was semi long when we got there but we were seated in a matter of 15 minutes. We all had shakes, my favorite is the Strawnilla side by side shake (half strawberry, half vanilla). The best thing on the menu in my opinion is the Frisco melt and there chilli is great. The food was good and the price beats Johnny Rockets anyway. We will be back! The service at our visit was a little slow so that is why I didn't give 5 stars.	positive
"What's this? A roomy yet cosy bar and pub, with a cute hidden beer-garden up the back. An inventive and delicious sounding gastropub menu. Quite a few different wines by the glass. And a two page cocktail menu. And comfy sofa seats. Oh, why hello Henrick's.\n\nFriday 5pm rolled around and the lovely Miss Emily V had chosen Henrick's for our post-work vino and grub spot. It's recently come under new management and all the previous reviews and comments of dissatisfied service have definitely been attended to.\n\nThe staff were absolutely lovely, really friendly and genuine without getting in our way too much (asking if we'd like another drink but not pushing it). It's really quite roomy inside with a variety of seating areas. We managed to score the comfy seat up the back by the window, which looks out onto a cute wee beer-garden. Might be worthwhile visiting in the half hour of summer we get this year.\n\nThe menu was really quite interesting for a gastropub. A duck and walnut salad on the starters menu. Cheek of sea bass, red snapper, pork loin with sweet potato, and the more traditional burgers, fish and chips and chilli. It took me quite a while to decide but I opted for the pork loin, whilst Miss V went for the Cajun Chicken Burger (which was actually a whole breast, grilled) served on a wholemeal roll.\n\nThe food was really quite nice. My pork loin was a little tough and dry, but I know pork is a tricky meat to cook. The salad it came with had a delicious pesto dressing, mango, apple and apple sauce. And sweet potato cubes. Yey! Cube-shaped chips are always so much better than normal chips. And bonus points for the sweet potato. Emily's burger was finished, and nomed, and was good. Quite a decent portion too. So overall, I was impressed by the food despite a dry pork loin.\n\nNow, the good stuff. I shall always remember Henrick's as the place I tried my first Manhattan. Both Emily and the waitress winced and said \""""ooo they're strong\"""" - and they were right - but it was delicious. We tried between us several cocktails. The margarita was made with table rather than rock salt, but other than that they were all absolutely delicious and better than 'gastropub that also serves cocktails' cocktails. Not 'cocktail bar' standard but much better than the standard fare.\n\nHenrick's really is a Jack of all trades, serving up breakfast and brunch, lunch, interesting dinners, cocktails, lots of wines by the glass, and lots of beers. It's a great all-rounder for any of the above, and the perfect place to come on a Friday evening after work for sure. It's got a really nice laid back vibe, and just quite ahhhh lovely.\n\nI'm definitely hitting up for brunch, and soon. Nom."	positive
Their pizza is a tease. It got to me. So light, crisp, thin crust. Or maybe it was the basil that enticed me?\n\nEither way, I enjoyed this venue because of our amazing waiter. He was so friendly and helpful. I wanted to order something off of the cafe menu instead of the dinner menu - which was not a problem. I had the Salmon Salad - requested it to not be too cooked- also not a problem. \n\nI was not feeling too well and he made me hot water and lemon and guaranteed it would make me feel better. And, maybe it was psychological or his nice actions but I definitely started to feel better and the headache was slowly going away...	positive
This is an excellent caf\u00e9. The baristas are extremely knowledgeable and friendly. They make your drink of choice with grace and love. This is serious artisanal coffee! My drink of choice is the Cortado or the Gibraltar (that is their moniker of choice for this particular drink at Pikolo) and it is excellent! Their blueberry scone is the best scone I've had outside of the U.K. but they go fast. Seriously, their scones are gone by like eleven o'clock... The early bird seriously gets the scone. Also their seasonal house fruit compote, granola and yoghourt parfait is sumptuous. Go here before, after or in between classes because it's a quick hop, skip and a jump away from McGill. Sit down, relax, read a book, study or daydream and let the world pass you by. If you're lucky you'll get a spot upstairs to set up shop and really enjoy your coffeehouse experience. Atop your regal perch you'll be able to survey your domain, pontificate over coffee and meditate on the universe. If you can't sit upstairs you should stay and sit downstairs and be in the mix. Enjoy!	positive
"We ate here on a Sunday morning and let's say I was pleasantly surprised on how good this place was. \nFirst off this is a \""""fast food\"""" breakfast place. It is not a waitress and sit down place. You put your order in, they call your number and you go get it and sit down where you find room. The food is served in paper plates and disposable silverware. However it is delicious and worth trying.\n\nI had the banana & nutella crepe and my husband some spicy egg crepe and we both loved it. The coffee is good and they have other beverages too. The menu is quite extensive and they make the crepes right there in front of you so they don't sit under a heat lamp. \n\nThe price is amazing too. If I worked uptown Charlotte I would eat here frequently."	positive
Pros: The staff is very friendly and seem knowledgeable about the mystic tan process (Or whatever its called ). I came in with a groupon and she was very accommodating. They do however tack on add-ons along with the tan , but oh well!\n\nCons: They were out of the the darker spray tan solution. Unfortunately I am pretty pale , so I really need a darker spray tan. After waiting the full 8 hours my tan was maybe only two shades above my natural color ! That was a let down considering I used the mystic tan for a special occasion. I ended up buying store bought tanning products to make myself darker.	negative
Waited for a crappy bartender to wait on me on a very uncrowded night.  I guess he was texting someone to find more stupid ass white rim glasses.  Still tipped him.  This place has taken a turn downhill, possibly? Shame jack's, for shame!   Lol!	negative
"Wurstle was the worst. Got a groupon ($5 for $10) as it indicated \""""gourmet\"""" sausages. They stick a hotdog type sausage (with little flavor) in a hollowed out baguette shaped roll (and stick some coleslaw yellow mustard and ketchup in it). The fries were baked in a toaster oven and the pickle was so soft and salty it was inedible. If I actually paid the full price of $10.71 I would have returned it.  Service was painfully slow."	negative
"For being $52.99 a person and surrounded with hype, I came in on a Friday night expecting a great buffet. I left very disappointed. Many items seen on yelp were not available. I'm guessing they've cut back on their offerings.\n\nThe prime rib lacked flavor. Everything else tasted average in comparison to cheaper buffets nearby. Mochi ice cream wasn't on display (????) they only gave them out upon request, and when I finally got it... They were pretty much melting and falling apart. \n\nThey have crab legs, yes, but so does a $35 buffet. The seafood selection was pretty limited.\n\nThe lamb chops and the sliders were really good, but I fail to see why this place carries so much hype with a high price tag. I really wanted to love this place, but in the end, it is just another \""""average good\"""" buffet that appears fancy. \n\nI might give it a second chance, but I won't be looking forward to it."	negative
Both time I have been here, I have had an AMAZING time! The dance floor was always packed, the drinks were strong (and pricey- but it's Vegas, what do you expect??), and the DJs were raging!  The most recent time I went, I danced myself into major cramping- did not know you can get cramps from dancing.  Maybe I'm just getting old :'(  \n\nMy only complaint was the guest list. Husband and I called twice- both times confirmed on the club's guest list.  But when we get there, no go- they tell us we're not on the list. Apparently, we should have asked for the name of the person we spoke to- even though we called the number listed on their own website and neither time did the person gave us their freaking name nor told us we needed that info for the guest list (No, no, you're totallllllly on the list- don't worry about it lol!). Lesson learned: get the names of every single person you speak to about getting in so you hopefully don't get screwed over. As irritating as that experience was though, the club itself more than makes up for it- I highly recommend coming here!	positive
Horrible. Horrible Service. Waiter never came by to check in on us and he forgot our chips and salsa plus a kids menu. Everyone was done with their meals and we still had no chicken tenders. Our food was mediocre and cold. The only thing I enjoyed was the grilled corn on the Cobb. Overall experience was horrible and I would recommend to go elsewhere.	negative
Despite being so close to the university, this was the first time I have ever been in here - and I'm really rather anoyyed at myself about that.\n\nThis place is great, a proper old school bookshop - split into 2 larger rooms and a third room that is more like a cupboard, this place has a huge amount of books in an even larger range of genres - both academical and leasurely reads. There are a lot of rare books and books which wouldnt be in more mainstream chain book stores, which adds a wonderful dimension to this book store.\n\nThe staff are friendly, as well as the dog that seems to live here, and the prices - while not cheap, are cheaper in comparison to places like Waterstones. \n\nThis place is great, and now I know it is here, I will be back!	positive
Excellent, excellent, excellent. If I lived in Montreal, I'd be a regular here. Looking for a good late night meal, my boyfriend and I came here around 1130 pm-- 30 minutes before closing. I expected to get dirty looks  from staff who wanted to close up shop and to be rushed through our meal. Instead, we were greeted warmly, given great service and the food was top-notch. \n\nWe tried the corn fritters, which were super yummy. I had the braised beef, while my boyfriend tried the bangers and mash for entrees. We could not have asked for a better meal. \n\nThis is a must-go-to place for locals and visitors alike.	positive
I really want to like this location... They are always very nice but EVERY SINGLE TIME I stop - it's completely empty and I end up waiting 15 to 20 min for food... Sorry guys but you are losing a ton of business !!!	negative
Really long waiting, mediocre food, below average and sometimes rude waiting staff. I have had buffets in multiple places in Vegas (Aria, Bellagio, Paris, Caesar's Palace) and Wynn is worse by orders of magnitude. After waiting in line for an hour and a half, the first thing our hostess told us was that we had 2 hours to finish. I felt welcome right then! After that, the waiter, who only had to bring us drinks, brought us water in the beginning and did not come back even when we asked him to. And then one of the busing guys seemingly jokingly did an act with couple other staff members to kick out folks sitting on the table next to us since they only had 8 minutes left for their 2 hours - the effect was that they left, and the rest in the room were left with a bad taste. And the food was nothing to write home about. If you're in Vegas, you have so many options that this buffet is certainly worth skipping. This is my first review on yelp. I was so annoyed with the whole buffet experience at Wynn that I registered with yelp and wrote the review sitting at the table!	negative
