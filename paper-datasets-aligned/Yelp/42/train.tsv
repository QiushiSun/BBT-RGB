Awesome... I just had the home made cheese sticks, accompanied with the Stone Porter Beer, followed by the Baked Alaskan Halibut Oscar... Not only am I a pig tonight, but a very happy man.	positive
After obtaining three quotes, my husband and I decided to go with the YELP review system and worked through J2 Cleaning. They were extremely professional on the phone, explained what needed to be done, their quote was similar to other companies, etc.  The technicians Jacob and Charles I believe were really really good. They explained the process to me, ensured the pet chemicals were being used, and were really careful about my dog, etc.  I will definitely use them again. Experienced. Friendly. Price Apporiately. Do Good Work. Satisfied Customer!	positive
My wife and I decided to take a detour through Charlotte on our way home to Augusta from Wilson, NC. We wanted to eat somewhere in Charlotte and decided to pick Cabo Fish Taco because they were featured on Diners, Driveins, and dives. Overall the atmosphere was nice and friendly. For some reason the same dumb song played multiple times during our time there. Not sure what that was about. We were seated in a section that looks like they might open it up to the outside in warmer months. Someone was smoking just on the other side and it was coming in the restaurant. \n\nWe ordered cabo rolls and tuna tacos. The tacos and avocado pasta were amazing but the cabo rolls were too salty to eat. When we let our server know she immediately got us a menu to order something in place of the cabo rolls. We ordered the carne asada tacos and they were delicious! The chips weren't warm. I've never been to a good Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve warm chips. They did tasted good and the salsa was yummy and we will definitely return if we ever get to Charlotte again!	positive
I had tried their com bi cha thit nuong rice dish. It was only so so. The grilled meat did not have much flavor as well as the cha. The place looks very clean and neat though. I haven't tried anything else from their menu yet, but the marinate for the thit nuong did not impress me at all. Maybe I'll give them another try again someday.....	negative
Great pizza. But too expensive. I usually like breaded pizza like deep dish, but this thin crust pizza ranks as some of the best I've ever had. I just wish it didn't cost an arm and a leg or I'd order more often	positive
"What else can I say that hasn't been said already?  \n\nI'm weirdly glad that they're not closer ( in fact very far away from me) because I'll be there every day = gaining tons of weight!\n\nMy baby loved the mango lassi flavor! So much he did the sign for \""""more \"""" for the first time at the store:)\n\nI do want to try the bacon flavor....so a trip soon is in order"	positive
This place rocks, I have used them more than a dozen times. Everyone is down to earth and excited to help you. From the owner to bottom they are amazing	positive
This review is based on the fact I was a guest here and live locally. I had to be at work early the next morning and was late due to the parking structure guy. \nUpon arriving at check in I asked for my white ticket to get validated. He gave me a parking pass and said I didnt need the white one. Sweet. \n\nTurns out I DID need that ticket and it caused me to be late. \nThe parking guy gave me 2 options: sit and wait for security to come and id have to prove that its my car (it wasnt...it was clearly a work truck)  or go back to the room where the white ticket was left. I tried waiting but 5 minutes seems like forever when you know youll be late by the time they figure out that you are legit. \nAfter having to re-park, go downstairs, then the elevator back up to the room then back down and out to the garagr.....uggh....yeah. I was late. \n\nNeedless to say, I probably wont stay here again.	negative
this place sucks worst place in town	negative
The best 10 dollar prime rib in las vegas, I had them all, from downtown to off the strip....\n\nthere prime is high quality for 10 dollar, the only bad thing, is it is only opn betwen 5pm to 11 pm	positive
I've been to Industry a couple of times now and I am unimpressed. While their beverage selection is fantastic, their service, and their food leave a lot to be desired. During my last visit, I ordered the Worker Burgher. It looked pretty fantastic. On the first bite I didn't care much for the bun. However, the meat patty was amazing. Perfectly seasoned, properly cooked, succulent. the onions and the goat cheese were perfect complements. I felt like finally I had found something I could get on board with food wise  at this place. (I had the Reuben previously and I'd never order that again.) then it all when downhill. On my third bite, I found a twsity tie inside of my hamburger. While our server and the manager both apologized and my hamburger was comped, I found little enjoyment finishing my meal. Perhaps it was my psyche, but I didn't feel so great later on that night. I was experiencing some pretty terrible stomach cramps for the rest of the evening. While I find the ambience of the place to be pretty cool, I think I'm gonna be passing up on future visits. What a shame. I was really trying to like the place.	negative
every time i go to this salon i leave disappointed. i will not be returning. for $150 i expect to be able to notice i did something to my hair.. find somewhere better.	negative
"We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of \""""Emerel's Blend\"""" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner."	negative
They need to learn how to bus tables. Two parties of two people waiting,  but they cleaned the largest tables while leaving the smaller tables and making us wait. \n\nThe food is good,  but not low priced anymore. Two people will spend about $25 on a meal.\n\nRecently sectioned off restaurant so they could serve kids. Goodbye to our quiet sanctuary restaurant.	negative
He did a great job. Please insist on a price quote before he does the work. We didn't and, while pleased with the work, we were sticker shocked by how expensive it was. Had the same work done by a larger local firm 4 months ago for about half the carpet guys price.	negative
Cosmo is so beautiful inside. The chandelier is really what makes it so spectacular. I've only visited here, I haven't stayed here so I can't rate the rooms. But with the staff I have dealt with here are very nice and helpful.	positive
Came here and was not disappointed.  The wait was a little long but the torta was delicious.  I had tried a couple of different tortas but they just do not compare.  I do not know if it is the ingredients, the chefs, or the combinations they have, but there tortas put all the rest to shame.  It is a good things I do not live in Phoenix or I would gain about 50lbs on these tortas alone.  Anytime I am within an hour drive of this place I will have to stop to get maybe one, two, or even three tortas just to satiate my craving.	positive
I used to be a big fan of Denny's until one day the hubby and I decided to try out Village Inn. Now, I'd much rather go to Village Inn over Denny's any day! \n\n The menu has a lot of options and a lot of items that other places just don't have. I love their eggs benedicts and the fact that you can build your own breakfast from a variety of options. The food is very well priced and very good quality. My husband and I have a breakfast date there once a week. I highly recommend this restaurant.	positive
This is a great place for tasty frozen drinks. Mango is super tasty, and prices were fairly reasonable. The employees are really nice and helpful in suggesting tasty flavor options. I'm thinking about coming here later for a Miami vice!	positive
There's lots of coupons floating around the web for this restaurant, so there's no reason to pay full price, but even if you do end up paying full price, the cost is reasonable.  They have a large menu featuring many vegetarian dishes, chicken, lamb, goat, and other traditional Indian foods.  Their lamb menu is extensive, and being a huge fan of lamb, I get some variety of lamb every time I come here.  I haven't eaten a single thing here that I didn't like. Their naan is to die for, particularly the garlic naan.\nI wasn't a big fan of their buffet.  It was small and there weren't very many spicy dishes. However, for those nervous about trying Indian food for the first time, the buffet menu offers a variety of mild, common indian dishes (they also serve you a plate of naan).\nI would say This is one of the best Indian places in town at this price range.	positive
There is sooo much going on I feel like I need to go see this show a few more times (if I had some kind of trust fund for that!) There are great acrobatics, music and dancing. I don't want to spoil anything, but there are a few times where you feel part of the show. This is theater in the the round so you do not need to bring your binoculars. If you like Beatles music (and even if you don't) the show is worth it.	positive
"One of the fun parts about life is trying things you've never tried before.\n\nMy boyfriend introduced me to Vietnamese food....and i do believe it is my new favorite.  I have been to Doan's 3x now, and i have to say i LOVE this place.\n\nLet me start with the staff and restaurant.  Despite your first impressions of the neighborhood and parking lot, Doan's is a nice, clean, pleasant restaurant to walk into.  They are super friendly, and willing to give you suggestions of what you might like.  \n\nHowever, might i suggest to you one of the 3 dishes I've tried there: \nVermicelli Bun To, with the pork, added meat balls and a spring roll.....so stinkin' good.  (I've added a couple pictures of that.)\n\nThe Sandwich with the pork (which was amazing!), i crave those things now...and I live in Raleigh!  sad day.  :/ \n\nOr the broken rice, which came with Pork, steak, and shrimp.  \n\nEverything was excellent.  The thing i like most, is that you can TASTE that it is grilled.  You don't get that at many place.\n\nAs far as drinks go, we tried the fresh limeade which was super good.  The Vietnamese Iced Coffee....it's made with sweeten condensed milk...seriously, how can anything be bad that has that in it?!  This iced coffee will make you stop going to the chain coffee house and go to doan's...it is that good.  And if you like it with a little bit of a chocolate twist, try the Lee's Coffee.\n\nBut my favorite....SUPER DE DUPER FAVORITE...in fact i would say it is so good, that if you put it on top of your head, your tongue would beat your brains out trying to get to it, is the Avocado Smoothie.  HOLY COW!....i NEVER knew Avocado could taste like this.   I noticed every table was ordering some sort of smoothie, so i asked our super nice waiter what it was and he told me it was a smoothie.  He said his favorite was the Avocado, so i said, BRING IT ON.  And I am soooo glad he did!\n\nApparently most countries use avocado as a \""""sweet\"""" treat, and this smoothie brings out a whole new side to avacado i never knew existed.   So if you're daring, and want something amazing go for the Avocado smoothie!!!  you will NOT regret it!  (They also have a green bean smoothie....i want to try that one next, but currently i'm so addicted to the avocado, i haven't ordered it yet.  lol.)\n\nIf you're looking for good eats, good prices, nice staff, and something different than the local chain, take a trip to Doan's, you will NOT be sad that you did."	positive
"How this place gets any more than one star is beyond me. \n\nThe first concern is the appetizers (falafel, hummus, baba ghanousj) are the furthest thing from Ethiopian.  If I wanted Middle Eastern food I would go to Pita Jungle. \n\nThe main courses are like \""""pseudo-Ethiopian\"""".  The meal descriptions are like written in a way you'd trick a child into eating something a little weird.  And no \""""doro wat\"""" on the menu !  That's like a Thai restaurant not having \""""Pad Thai\"""". The main dish Americans eat. \n\nThe food. Bland and boring. \n\nDon't bother going."	negative
It's all about New York style pizza. Deep dish is so overrated. For me, pizza is all about the crust and Grimaldi's did a great job of baking the pizza to the right crispiness. Out of the many things we ordered, my favorite was the Mushroom Chicken. The sauce had a great flavor and the cheese was so fresh it made me want to punch babies. The white sauce pizza was good but it didn't have enough flavor for me. I still ate a bunch of slices though. Our server was really nice and attentive. Good food, good service, good times.	positive
This restaurant has replaced the Wolfgang Puck Bistro that recently closed.\nI'm being gracious here with 2 stars. The first time I went last week, the service was extremely slow. He swiped my credit card and finally handed me my receipt 20 minutes later. It took him 15 minutes to come to me and apologize, but even then, he didn't tell me what was going on. He kept walking back and forth and talking on the phone with someone, because the computer was not cooperating. \nThe interior of the place is nice though, with flat-screen TVs on the sports channel and nice bar to sit at. The other workers there seemed to be having a good time as well. \nThe food was bleh. I had the Baked Feta and Marinara starter, which was basically garlic bread with a huge bowl of marinara sauce mixed with feta cheese. Also, they gave me the wrong order. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap, and when I got home, I opened up a chicken bacon ranch wrap. Oh well!! Thumbs down to this place. If I go back, it will be just to see if their pizza is any better.	negative
I am a little worried about getting clobbered by cheap looking Coach bags from all sides for this.\nAt the same time a bit giddy to give Coach its first 1 star review.\nI don't get it. I really don't. \nI love designer clothes as much if not more than the rest of the female population. I ooh, ahh, pet, purr, swoon over purses and shoes and will go through hell for a good deal or fabulous pair of heels.\nWith that I do not get the Coach hype.\nNot at all, not one bit. \nThey are not upperclass, though you will still pay a few hundred for kitchy, logo covered (yawn!!!), bland and lifeless handbags that everyone around you has as well.\nThey make you stand in line to get in the damn store (not that I would want to) so that you think you are getting some kind of amazing deal.\nI get cheap, fun purses, but these are not. \nI get handmade, organic, buttery soft croc leather for thousands, but these are not.\nThey are the not needed mainstream ho hum that I refuse to participate in.\nFind me at Saks, Neimans, Nordstrom or Loehman's looking for that breathtaking purse that someone must have overlooked waiting for me with a big red clearance tag on it.	negative
I got lucky coming across vipnvegas.  Not only was our promoter really nice but he got us a really great price, literally 300 less than other promoters ( from different companies).  We ended up going to 1oak, (for my bachelor party) and it was legendary.  We had a great spot, grouped in with two other groups  In a three table area, which was great cause everyone was celebrating together.  The truth is for the price, he could've put me anywhere in that club.  With my wedding being in Hawaii and only a month away, we were working with a strict budget, but it worked out amazingly thanks to Adam.  If you like clubs that play primarily hip hop, 1oak at the mirage is the spot. It was smackin hard, although it was Fourth of July weekend/fight night, the streets were packed.  Anyways, Adam was extremely helpful, not fake at all.  Id recommend him over anyone.	positive
order:\n\ncrab cake appetizer\nJack Daniels Burger w/ onion rings\nSizzling Chicken & Shrimp w/ sweet potato fried\n\nCrab Cake: was ok a bit bland the sauce helped alot but still couldve been better and was ok.\n\nJack Daniels Burger: was delish.  flavors went well everything was cooked as asked.\n\nSizzling Chicken & shrimp. ooooooooooook. we had a major problem here. 2 cheeses are suppose to be in there but it was just 1 american cheese. meh. i had ordered the sweet potato as a side but the waiter came back out saying he can switched my mash potato for the fries. so i agreed canceling the side. the shrimp was alright. nothing special. the chicken was oil under marinated. and just bland in general. the sweet potato fries.. was HORRIBLE. adding salt DOES NOT COMPLIMENT the fries AT ALL. if it was under salted it was fine. but i literally saw chunks on salt all over it... so that was left untouched...after a bite.\n\nour waitor tried to charge us for the side of sweet when it was suppose to be switched out :( but he cancelled that for us.. which is great. over all the food wasnt that great here :(	negative
Stayed there Dec 23-25\n23rd - 2.5 hr wait for dinner, $34.95,decided to go the next night.\n24th - 2 hr wait wait for dinner, $44.95\n25th - 2hr wait for brunch, $44.95\n\nMade it to dinner on the 24th.  I know it's a buffet so I expect to wait, I know it's Christmas Eve so I expect to get jacked on the price even though the menu was the same the night before.  Finally sit down to eat.  They must of been short on items this night.  They ran out on a few items, e.g. sushi only had 2 different rolls and one had roll.  Ran out of cod fish.\n\nWhere do you get off charging $50 bucks (after taxes) for crap ass buffet that's short on items during the holidays?!  What a rip!  Dinner for two was $100.  You can eat at so many nice restaurants for that kind of money.  BTW, the king crab was rubbery!\n\nI'm never going back to the Wynn.  Will stay at the Bellagio, the buffet is better there anyhow.	negative
I decided to try somewhere new for lunch today and my girlfriend suggested we head to this place. Checked Yelp and was excited to see a few good reviews. We arrived and were seated quickly by a very nice hostess.  Our server came over and while he was friendly and attentive he smelled terrible.  Every time he walked by our table he trailed a tear inducing odor. We still weren't ready to completely give up on the place despite the server's poor hygiene and decided to order:\n\nChicken Bruschetta\nA small Pepperoni Pizza\nand some Fettuccine Alfredo\n\nThe Chicken Bruschetta came out first and looked fantastic. The presentation was excellent but upon biting into it we learned it was made entirely from salt. The sliced chicken on top of it looked as if it had been bought frozen and just thawed and tossed on top.\n\nWhen the Pizza and the Alfredo came, again both looked amazing, we were setup for even more disappointment.  How you screw up Alfredo is beyond me but it seemed like they forgot to add cheese and just gave us some noodles in a pool of condensed milk.  I never thought of pouring milk over noodles for breakfast but now I know that it wouldn't substitute for cereal.\n\nNow onto the pizza, I'll be honest it I liked it. A little bit heavy on the cheese but if we had just gotten this take out and not sat in to enjoy the scents I probably would have given the place a 4.  However even pizza is extremely hard to choke that down with a scent that can best be described as urine soaked hobo. We paid, left, and probably still tipped better than we should have.  I wouldn't recommend this place, if the servers can't be bothered to shower and wash their clothes once in a while who knows what goes on in the back.	negative
What a dump. I asked for a non smoking room. I didn't get one. The door man was rude and demanding. \n\nI had to leave, the amount I was asked to pay was a ripoff.; I'd rather sleep in the car!\n\n  My suggestion is to try some of the hotels in Summerlin. It's worth the drive.	negative
Went during Restauraunt Week here in Las Vegas and the food was delicious. Although we were suppose to get the quail, they had run out and replaced it with prosciutto (reason for 4 stars because it was mighty salty and not equivalent to eating quail). We had the grilled kobe beef sirloin which was delicious. The diver sea scallops were tender and moist. The dessert was melt in your mouth good.	positive
